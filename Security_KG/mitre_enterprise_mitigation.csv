M1042,Disable or Remove Feature or Program,Remove or deny access to unnecessary and potentially vulnerable software to prevent abuse by adversaries.
M1055,Do Not Mitigate,This category is to associate techniques that mitigation might increase risk of compromise and therefore mitigation is not recommended.
M1041,Encrypt Sensitive Information,Protect sensitive information with strong encryption.
M1039,Environment Variable Permissions,Prevent modification of environment variables by unauthorized users and groups.

M1050,Exploit Protection,Use capabilities to detect and block conditions that may lead to or be indicative of a software exploit occurring.
M1037,Filter Network Traffic,Use network appliances to filter ingress or egress traffic and perform protocol-based filtering. Configure software on endpoints to filter network traffic.
M1035,Limit Access to Resource Over Network,"Prevent access to file shares, remote access to systems, unnecessary services. Mechanisms to limit access may include use of network concentrators, RDP gateways, etc."
M1034,Limit Hardware Installation,"Block users or groups from installing or using unapproved hardware on systems, including USB devices."
M1033,Limit Software Installation,Block users or groups from installing unapproved software.
M1032,Multi-factor Authentication,Use two or more pieces of evidence to authenticate to a system; such as username and password in addition to a token from a physical smart card or token generator.
M1031,Network Intrusion Prevention,Use intrusion detection signatures to block traffic at network boundaries.
M1030,Network Segmentation,"Architect sections of the network to isolate critical systems, functions, or resources. Use physical and logical segmentation to prevent access to potentially sensitive systems and information. Use a DMZ to contain any internet-facing services that should not be exposed from the internal network. Configure separate virtual private cloud (VPC) instances to isolate critical cloud systems."
M1028,Operating System Configuration,Make configuration changes related to the operating system or a common feature of the operating system that result in system hardening against techniques.
M1027,Password Policies,Set and enforce secure password policies for accounts.
M1056,Pre-compromise,"This category is used for any applicable mitigation activities that apply to techniques occurring before an adversary gains Initial Access, such as Reconnaissance and Resource Development techniques."
M1026,Privileged Account Management,"Manage the creation, modification, use, and permissions associated to privileged accounts, including SYSTEM and root."
M1025,Privileged Process Integrity,"Protect processes with high privileges that can be used to interact with critical system components through use of protected process light, anti-process injection defenses, or other process integrity enforcement measures."
M1029,Remote Data Storage,Use remote security log and sensitive file storage where access can be controlled better to prevent exposure of intrusion detection log data or sensitive information.
M1022,Restrict File and Directory Permissions,Restrict access by setting directory and file permissions that are not specific to users or privileged accounts.
M1044,Restrict Library Loading,Prevent abuse of library loading mechanisms in the operating system and software to load untrusted code by configuring appropriate library loading mechanisms and investigating potential vulnerable software.
