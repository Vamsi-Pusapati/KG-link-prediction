    "comment": "A conducting equipment used to represent a connection to ground which is typically used to compensate earth faults.   An earth fault compensator device modelled with a single terminal implies a second terminal solidly connected to ground.  If two terminals are modelled, the ground is not assumed and normal connection rules apply.",
